           To rent a motorcycle from us you should have:
- a valid Motorcycle Licence (non-ZIM licences are accepted as long as they show your motorcycle entitlement)
- hold a current passport
- provide 2 other forms of ID and address (within the past 3 months)
We offer hire packages on Soft Luggage, Helmets and Protective Clothing (Textile Jackets, Textile Trousers and Gloves).
All Motorcycles hired from Aygel Motorcycles come with Fully Comprehensive Insurance, ZIM Roadside assistance, a full tank of Fuel; and UNLIMITED Mileage as standard.  Motorcycles are to be returned with a full tank of fuel ($30 standard charge for Motorcycles returned without a full tank).
A damage waiver fee of $500.00 is payable on collection of the motorcycle and will be refunded upon safe return of all hire items.

*  Insurance Excess is for information only.   We do not take payment for the Insurance Excess up front, we merely make you aware of the insurance terms.
It is possible to reduce the insurance excess with a one off payment
